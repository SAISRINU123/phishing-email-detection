# phishing-email-detection
The primary goal of this project is to develop/deploy a controlled environment to simulate Social Engineering attacks. It serves as a training tool to identify vulnerabilities in human behavior, measure organizational "click rates," and provide immediate "teachable moment" feedback to users who fall for simulated phishing attempts.
